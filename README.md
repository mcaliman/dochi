DocBook5 Renderer and Analyzer ( more informations available at http://docbook.org/ )

DocBook is a semantic markup language for technical documentation. 
It was originally intended for writing technical documents related to computer hardware and 
software but it can be used for any other sort of documentation[1]. 

DocBook 5.0 is an OASIS standard.

I'm adding new feature from time to time.

The command line to include the bindings is
xjc -extension -d /home/outdir/output -b binding.xml docbook.xsd
