		<para>But there must be still other countless errors of the same
      sort that no living man can yet detect, because of the fog within which
      our type of Western culture envelops us.  Cultural influences have set
      up the assumptions about the mind, the body, and the universe with which
      we begin; pose the questions we ask; influence the facts we seek;
      determine the interpretations we give these facts; and direct our
      reaction to these interpretations and conclusions.</para>
